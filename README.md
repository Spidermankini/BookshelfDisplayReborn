# BookshelfDisplayReborn:

Recompiled version of BookshelfDisplay by Cynadyde for use on more recent game versions. Targets 1.18.2 primarily, developed against JDK 8.0 for compatibility but is largely untested on other game versions. 

Original git repo can be found here containing versions <1.17.1, but in theory this updated version will work on all versions above 1.14 (1.17.1-1.19 has been tested): https://github.com/Cynadyde/BookshelfDisplay

# Original BookshelfDisplay Descriptor:

BookshelfDisplay is a SpigotMC Plugin that lets the player use bookshelves to display galleries of books.
Visit this plugin's [SpigotMC Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bookshelfdisplay.67225/) for more information.

To install, simply place the jar file in your server's `plugins` folder. You will need a single dependency, 
[ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/). (Make sure it is the latest version!) 
Place this jar in your `plugins` folder, also.
